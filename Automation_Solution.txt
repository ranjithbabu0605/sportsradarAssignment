Automation approach:
Cucumber BDD frame work was used by wrting the the test case using Gherkin language and creating request classes and functions.

Explanation:
BasePage: holds delays and sleep
Pages : Repository of objects for all pages (IN this case there is only one page)
HomePage: Holds all the webelements and functions of the landing page.
StepDefenitions: Holds all the functions that define the steps in the "timer.feature" file
RunCucumberTest: Suite that runs the test
timer.feature : Contains all the scenarios to test


Scenarios Covered: 
1. Verify that the help and settings are available after clicking the help and settings button.
2. Verify that there are 2 sample timer available in the home page
3. Verify that the countdown timer is taken as seconds when giving a time value in format “ n seconds” in the textbox and clicking start.
4. Verify that the countdown timer is taken when using one of the sample timer available
5. Verify that the countdown timer does not start when giving an invalid value.
